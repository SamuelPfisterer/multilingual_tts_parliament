In the `getting_links` folder, we retrieve the media links and the transcript texts. This folder contains CSV files with links to MP4 and MP3 files, as well as unique transcript IDs.

We attempted to download the videos using these links, but the process took a considerable amount of time and many of the downloads were unsuccessful due to various errors, such as connection timeouts and FFmpeg issues.
